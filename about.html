                Hi! My name is <strong>Ikhsan</strong>. I am a 7th grade student, and together with my friend
                <strong>Dayan</strong>, we decided to create a project based on a problem we faced ourselves.
            </p>

            <div class="story-grid">
                <div class="story-card">
                    <h3>The Problem 💻</h3>
                    <p>
                        One day, while Dayan was playing games, his laptop started lagging badly.
                        We checked what was causing the issue and noticed that Google Chrome was
                        using almost all available RAM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We tried popular optimization extensions, but most of them either didn’t work,
                        slowed the browser even more, or caused websites to crash.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-card">
                    <h3>The Idea 💡</h3>
                    <p>
                        We asked ourselves a simple question:
                        <em>“What if we create our own lightweight extension?”</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We wanted something simple, fast, and reliable —
                        especially for weak or older laptops, without complicated settings.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="main-text">
                <p>
                    A few days later, our school announced the <strong>Infomatrix competition</strong>.
                    This gave us strong motivation to turn our idea into a real product.
                    That’s how <strong>CSB (Chrome Speed Booster)</strong> was born.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    “Our goal was not to build a complex system.
                    We wanted to create a tool that stays fast, stable,
                    and respects user privacy.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    While working on CSB, we learned how to analyze real problems,
                    design practical solutions, and turn ideas into working software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CSB is made for students, gamers, and everyday users who use Chrome on low-end or older devices,
                    but still want their browser to feel smooth and responsive.
                    We are proud of what we have built and continue to improve it.
