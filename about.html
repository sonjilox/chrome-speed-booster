                Hello, my name is <strong>Ikhsan</strong>. I am a 7th grade student, and together with my friend <strong>Dayan</strong>, we created a project based on a real problem.
            </p>

                <div class="story-card">
                    <h3>The Problem 💻</h3>
                    <p>While playing games, Dayan’s laptop started lagging. We noticed Google Chrome was eating all the RAM. Standard extensions didn't help — they made it worse or crashed the sites.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-card">
                    <h3>The Idea 💡</h3>
                    <p>We asked ourselves: "What if we make our own lightweight extension?" We wanted something that actually works on weak laptops without complicated settings.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="main-text">
                <p>A few days later, our school announced the <strong>Informatrix competition</strong>. This motivated us even more. We decided to turn our idea into a real project and started working on <strong>CSB (Chrome Speed Booster)</strong>.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Our goal was not to make something complicated. We wanted to create a tool that stays fast, stable, and respects privacy."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Through this project, we learned how to solve real problems using technology. CSB is made for students and everyday users who have older laptops but still need their browser to work smoothly. We are proud of what we have built.</p>
